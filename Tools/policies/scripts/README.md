The script mcpolicy is to allow a quick creation of a policy output in display form without mediaconch. The suggested command presumed that you did a `cd` into this directory.


```
./mcpolicy -p ../sample_policy_4_mkv_ffv1_digitization.xml -d ../../displays/MediaConchHtml.xsl some_random.mkv > policy_output.html && open policy_output.html
```
